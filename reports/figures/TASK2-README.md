# 📈 Task 2: Quantitative Analysis Using PyNance and TA-Lib

This task enhances our financial news sentiment project by integrating **technical stock analysis** using historical OHLCV data and computing indicators with TA-Lib and PyNance. The results will be visualized and documented for use in financial modeling and dashboards.

---

## 🔧 Setup & Branching

- ✅ Merge the final `task-1` branch into `main` via Pull Request.
- ✅ Create a new working branch from `main`: `task-2`
- ⬜ Set up a GitHub project board column: `📈 Task 2: Quant Analysis`
- ⬜ Use descriptive commit messages (e.g. `feat(indicators): added RSI calc`)

---

## 📊 Data Acquisition & Preparation

- ⬜ Load historical stock price data (OHLCV)
- ⬜ Ensure required columns: `Open`, `High`, `Low`, `Close`, `Volume`, `Date`
- ⬜ Parse and sort by `Date` (datetime format)
- ⬜ Handle missing values or gaps
- ⬜ Script: `src/finance/loader.py`

---

## 📐 Technical Indicators – TA-Lib

- ⬜ Install and configure `TA-Lib`
- ⬜ Script: `src/finance/ta_indicators.py`
- ⬜ Implement:
  - ⬜ SMA (Simple Moving Average)
  - ⬜ EMA (Exponential Moving Average)
  - ⬜ RSI (Relative Strength Index)
  - ⬜ MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)
- ⬜ Add tests using `pytest`

---

## 📈 Financial Metrics – PyNance

- ⬜ Configure PyNance to calculate:
  - ⬜ Volatility
  - ⬜ Momentum
  - ⬜ Beta (optional)
- ⬜ Integrate indicators and metrics into a unified DataFrame
- ⬜ Unit testing for consistency

---

## 📊 Visualization

- ⬜ Script: `src/finance/visualizer.py`
- ⬜ Plot:
  - ⬜ Price overlays with SMA/EMA
  - ⬜ RSI with thresholds
  - ⬜ MACD histogram
  - ⬜ Volume bars
- ⬜ Enable `make run-notebooks` to show sample visualizations

---

## 📋 Documentation & CI/CD

- ⬜ Update `README.md` with usage and setup instructions
- ⬜ Document indicator reference links and examples
- ⬜ Add commands to `Makefile`:
  - ⬜ `make indicators`
  - ⬜ `make visualize-finance`
- ⬜ Ensure all tests are CI-covered
